        <b><h1>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h1></b>
        It is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges in a
        graph or tree structure. <br />It starts from a given node (called the
        root or starting node) and explores all of its neighboring nodes first
        before moving on to their neighbors. It does this level by level,
        meaning it explores all nodes at one depth level before moving on to the
        next level. <br /><br /><b>Simple Steps:</b>
        <list>
          <ol>
            Start from the root node (or any starting point).
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Visit all its immediate neighbors (the nodes directly connected to
            it).
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Move to the next level and visit the neighbors of those nodes.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Continue this process until all nodes are visited.
          </ol>
          <pre>
              A
            /   \
           B     C
          / \   / \
         D   E F   G
      
          </pre>
        </list>
        <p>
          BFS starts at A, visits B and C (the neighbors of A), then moves to
          the next level and visits D, E, F, and G. BFS explores nodes
          breadth-wise, i.e., level by level, from left to right.

        <b><h1>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h1></b>
        It is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges in a graph or tree. Unlike BFS, which explores nodes level by level, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.<br /><br /><br /><b>Simple Steps:</b>
        <list>
          <ol>
            Start from the root node (or any starting point).
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Explore as far as possible along each branch before moving to the next branch
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Visit nodes by going deep into the graph before backtracking to explore other paths.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            Continue this process until all nodes are visited.
          </ol>
          <pre>
              A
            /   \
           B     C
          / \   / \
         D   E F   G
      
          </pre>
        </list>
        <p>
            DFS starts at A, explores as deep as possible along one branch, for example, going from A to B to D (leftmost path).
            After reaching D, it backtracks to B and then explores E.
            Once it finishes exploring Bâ€™s children, it backtracks to A and explores C.
            It continues by exploring F and then G.
